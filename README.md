# Solidity Address Table - L2 rollups gas saver â›½ 
This repository provides an contract that can be used to save the gas

L2 Rollup blockchains(such as Arbitrum, Optimism, etc) can significantly reduce cost of the contract execution. As of now most of them are saving the call's calldata into underlying L1 blockchain(mostly Ethereum) and that can be **quite** expensive. 

Calling contracts on rollup chains is _(relativly)_ cheap, but their calldata can cost a lot.

## Solidity Address Book

One of the tricks to shorten the calldata is to pass addresses as indices. Indeed, instead of passing **20 bytes** of `address` such as `	0xb38e8c17e38363af6ebdcb3dae12e0243582891d` (that's actually passed as a **32 bytes** word `000000000000000000000000b38e8c17e38363af6ebdcb3dae12e0243582891d`) we can simply use `0x44`(**ONE** byte, `uint8`) - index of the record in the address table.
