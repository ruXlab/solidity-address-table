# Solidity Address Table - L2 rollups gas saver â›½ 
This repository provides an contract that can be used to save the gas

L2 Rollup blockchains(such as Arbitrum, Optimism, etc) can significantly reduce cost of the contract execution. As of now most of them are saving the call's calldata into underlying L1 blockchain(mostly Ethereum) and that can be **quite** expensive. 

Calling contracts on rollup chains is _(relativly)_ cheap, but their calldata can cost a lot.

## Solidity Address Book

One of the tricks to shorten the calldata is to pass addresses as indices. Indeed, instead of passing **20 bytes** of `address` such as `	0xb38e8c17e38363af6ebdcb3dae12e0243582891d` (that's actually passed as a **32 bytes** word `000000000000000000000000b38e8c17e38363af6ebdcb3dae12e0243582891d`) we can simply use `0x44`(**ONE** byte, `uint8`) - index of the record in the address table.


## Implementations

There are a number of implementations that might be better suited for specific projects.

Highlights 
* Efficiently store Ethereum addresses in an internal array within contract.
* Add single or multiple addresses using `_addressBookAdd` and `_addressBookAddMany` functions.
* Retrieve the total number of addresses using the _addressBookSize function.

### EmbeddedAddressTableX8

[EmbeddedAddressTableX8](./contracts/EmbeddedAddressTableX8.sol) is a Solidity contract module designed to efficiently store and manage a collection of Ethereum addresses. It provides an internal array-based storage solution with a maximum capacity of 255 addresses. This module is well-suited for applications where a simple address registry with basic management functionality is needed.

### EmbeddedAddressTableX16

[EmbeddedAddressTableX16](./contracts/EmbeddedAddressTableX16.sol) is a similar contract module to `EmbeddedAddressTableX8`, with the difference being that it can store up to 65535 Ethereum addresses, providing a larger capacity for address storage.

Both contracts expose a set of internal functions to add, remove, and query addresses, making it easy to integrate with other contracts. They also include derived test contracts (EmbeddedAddressTableX8Test and EmbeddedAddressTableX16Test) which allow for convenient testing of the core functionality.


#### Usage

To integrate either `EmbeddedAddressTableX8` or `EmbeddedAddressTableX16` into your contract, inherit from the desired contract and utilize the provided internal functions for managing addresses. These modules are abstract and not intended for direct deployment. The derived test contracts [EmbeddedAddressTableX8Test](./contracts/test/EmbeddedAddressTableX8Test.sol) and [EmbeddedAddressTableX16Test](./contracts/test/EmbeddedAddressTableX16Test.sol) can be used for testing purposes, allowing you to verify the functionality and behavior of the core contracts.
